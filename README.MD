- Add/edit/delete agencies, clients, employees, jobs, shifts, timesheets, and payroll.
- Sample data can be populated via the Django shell (see previous instructions).

---

## Extending / Customizing

- Add your branding, business logic, or frontend (React/Vue/Angular, etc).
- Can be hosted on AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean and with custom domain and HTTPS.
